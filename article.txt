Article 370 of the Indian Constitution was a temporary provision that granted special autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). Introduced in 1949, it allowed J&K to have its own constitution, state flag, and autonomy over internal administration, while the Indian government retained authority only over defense, foreign affairs, finance, and communications. This meant that laws passed by the Indian Parliament did not automatically apply to J&K unless the state government concurred. Additionally, non-residents of J&K were barred from purchasing property in the state, and until a 2002 court ruling, women who married outside the state lost their inheritance rights. The provision was rooted in the Instrument of Accession signed by Maharaja Hari Singh in 1947, when J&K joined India amid the Indo-Pak partition.  

On August 5, 2019, the Indian government revoked Article 370 through a presidential order and a parliamentary resolution, effectively stripping J&K of its special status. The state was bifurcated into two Union Territories: Jammu & Kashmir (with a legislature) and Ladakh (without one). This move integrated J&K fully into India’s constitutional framework, extending all central laws and allowing non-residents to buy property. The government argued that this would promote economic development, curb terrorism, and strengthen national integration. However, the decision faced fierce opposition from regional political parties like the National Conference and the People’s Democratic Party, who viewed it as an assault on J&K’s identity and a violation of federal principles. The revocation also sparked legal challenges, with petitions pending in the Supreme Court questioning its constitutional validity.  

Since the abrogation, J&K has seen increased central oversight, with promises of eventual statehood restoration. While the government highlights infrastructure projects and investments as signs of progress, critics point to continued security challenges, internet restrictions, and unresolved political discontent. The long-term implications of this historic decision remain a subject of intense debate, balancing questions of sovereignty, development, and regional autonomy in one of India’s most sensitive regions.
